# Day 06 – Linux Fundamentals & Shell Health Checks

## Goal
Practice Linux fundamentals and build a basic node health check script using shell scripting.

## What I did
- Learned core OS components like kernel and system utilities.
- Practiced essential Linux commands for disk, memory, and file operations.
- Wrote a shell script with metadata, proper shebang, and health check logic.
- Used pipes to combine commands for process inspection.

## What this proves
- I can write structured shell scripts, not just terminal commands.
- I understand how Linux exposes system health information.
- I follow scripting best practices like metadata and portability.
- I can read system output and derive operational meaning from it.

## How this helps a client/employer
- I can monitor system health at the OS level.
- I can diagnose performance issues using native Linux tools.
- I can build quick diagnostic scripts for operations teams.
- I can standardize system checks through reusable scripts.
